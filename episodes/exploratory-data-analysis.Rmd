::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Use `workflowr` function `wflow_publish()` to publish your website.  
- List the three steps involved in executing a call to `wflow_publish` function  
- Recognize that "publishing" your website synchronizes html files (ie, those outputted from rendering Rmd files) and the source Rmd files. By itself, it doesn't post your site to the internet.
