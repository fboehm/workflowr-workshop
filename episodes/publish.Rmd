:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 


- How do I add a new Rmd file for additional analyses and incorporate it into my website?  

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Use `workflowr` function `wflow_publish()` to publish your website.  
- Add exploratory data analysis R code (and outputs like figures) to your analysis  
- Recognize that "publishing" your website synchronizes html files (ie, those outputted from rendering Rmd files) and the source Rmd files. By itself, it doesn't post your site to the internet.

## `workflowr` & "publishing" analysis website  

- `wflow_publish` to synchronize outputted htmls and source Rmds  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
wflow_publish(files = "analysis/*.Rmd",
    message = "feat: rendered all Rmds to htmls for website" # fred likes informative git commit messages... but also try to not write too much
)
```
